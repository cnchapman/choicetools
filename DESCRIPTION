Title: Tools for Choice Modeling, Conjoint Analysis, and MaxDiff analysis of Best-Worst Surveys
Version: 0.0.0.9077
Author: Chris Chapman, Eric Bahna, James Alford, Steven Ellis
Maintainer: Chris Chapman <cchapman+choice@google.com>
Description: Functions to read or simulate data, estimate models, perform
    preference simulation, and plot model coefficients for choice-based conjoint (CBC)
    and best-worst (using MaxDiff) surveys. Includes import of CBC and MaxDiff data from 
    Sawtooth Software, and MaxDiff data from Qualtrics. Some functions are intended to be 
    production quality (e.g., MaxDiff estimation) whereas others are experimental (e.g., 
    attribute importance) or for didactic purposes (e.g., writing a CBC design to CSV 
    spreadsheet). See vignettes and individual function documentation (in progress) 
    for details. This package completely incorporates and supercedes previous "Rcbc.R" scripts.
